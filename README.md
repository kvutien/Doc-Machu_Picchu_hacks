This document reminds what is Machu Picchu and describes potential ETH Global 2025 projects that can be carried out on the theme of Machu Picchu.

Machu Picchu is an open-source project that leverages 21st century tools for humanitarian purposes: https://kvutien-yes.medium.com/project-machu-picchu-white-paper-2024-part-1-735b60c55a92. With the severe cuts tha the new US Trump administration has imposed on humanitarian budgets, these organizations would take the opportunity to think outside the routine practices and consider the facilities brought by the Internet, mow-cost low consumption Raspberry-Pi's and similar, free Earth Observation resources and tools, blockchain technologies and Artiificial Intelligence.

The Inca citadel Machu Picchu was built using huge stones, themselves well crafted, that together make even bigger monuments.
